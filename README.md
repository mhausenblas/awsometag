# awsometag

After reading and reflecting on [Allocate AWS Costs with Resource Tags](https://medium.com/@davidevanpaulis/allocate-aws-costs-with-resource-tags-277de240487f) 
I asked myself: is there a CLI tool out there, ideally with a great UX, 
that allows me to tag *any* AWS resource in a uniform manner? 
After some searching around I concluded that the answer is likely "No" 
and so I set out to fill this gap with `awsometag`.

But, I hear you say, there are [AWS Resource Groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/welcome.html) (ARG), already!
Isn't this re-inventing the wheel?

Nope. And the reason is two-fold: on the one hand, you can consider `awsometag` as
a sort of enabler for ARGs; you don't have to think about the grouping aspect up-front,
only tag your resources. Second, ARGs are very powerful, supporting more than simple
tags, including CloudFormation stack-based queries and a set of permissions 
along with the ARG. In a sense, if one was to compare `awsometag` to ARGs, it would
be roughly offering the functionality of the [Tag Editor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ARG/latest/userguide/tag-editor.html).

## Install it
Install it by downloading one of the [binaries](https://github.com/mhausenblas/awsometag/releases) or,
if you have Go 1.12+ installed, you can clone this repo and build it from source.

## Use it

`awsometag` takes exactly three arguments: 

1. the ARN of the resource to tag,
1. the region, and 
1. a list of comma-separated tags in the format `key=value`

That is, the general usage pattern is as follows:

```sh
$ awsometag RESOURCE_ARN REGION "TAG_KEY1=TAG_VAL1,TAG_KEY2=TAG_VAL2,..."
```

Currently, the following services are supported by `awsometag`:

- [IAM](#iam)
- [S3](#s3)
- [EKS](#eks)

### IAM

If you want to tag the IAM user `arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/abc` with
`nice=person` and `they=oweme` then you'd want to use the following:

```sh
# tag:
$ awsometag arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/abc - "nice=person, they=oweme"

# verify the tagging:
$ aws iam list-user-tags \
      --user-name abc
{
    "Tags": [
        {
            "Key": "nice",
            "Value": "person"
        },
        {
            "Key": "they",
            "Value": "oweme"
        }
    ],
    "IsTruncated": false
}
```

Note: the same works for IAM roles. Also: since IAM is a global service, 
we don't specify a region here, that is, you can pass whatever value you
want there as the second argument, it will be ignoredâ€”however, some value is 
required, so I chose `-`.

### S3

To tag the bucket `arn:aws:s3:::abucket` with `thats=cool` you would use:

```sh
# tag:
$ awsometag arn:aws:s3:::abucket us-west-2 thats=cool
2020/01/04 13:54:32 Tagging S3 bucket 'abucket' with thats:cool

# verify the tagging:
$ aws s3api get-bucket-tagging \
      --bucket abucket
{
    "TagSet": [
        {
            "Key": "thats",
            "Value": "cool"
        }
    ]
}
```

Same works for objects in a bucket: let's tag the object with the key 
`input.csv` residing in the bucket `abucket` with `this=aswell`:

```sh
# tag:
$ awsometag arn:aws:s3:::abucket/input.csv us-west-2 this=aswell
2020/01/05 07:03:50 Tagging S3 object 'input.csv' in bucket 'abucket' with this:aswell

# verify the tagging:
$ aws s3api get-object-tagging \
     --bucket abucket \
     --key input.csv
{
    "TagSet": [
        {
            "Key": "this",
            "Value": "aswell"
        }
    ]
}
```

### EKS

To tag the EKS cluster `arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:123456789102:cluster/somecluster` 
with `my=containers`, use the following:

```sh
# tag:
$ awsometag arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:123456789102:cluster/somecluster us-west-1 my=containers
2020/01/05 08:26:03 Tagging EKS cluster 'somecluster' in region 'us-west-1' with my:containers

# verify the tagging:
$ aws eks list-tags-for-resource \
      --resource-arn arn:aws:eks:us-west-2:123456789102:cluster/somecluster
{
    "tags": {
        "my": "containers"
    }
}
```

Note: the same works for tagging [managed node groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managed-node-groups.html).
